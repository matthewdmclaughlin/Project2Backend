Welcome to the back end of Block'busta - a platform for keeping track of your digital media on the internets!  No more digging through drawers and boxes - just hop on Block Busta and see what you've got to watch.  Also save on bandwidth by not streaming!

This app allows a user to save the following information related to their dvds: Title, Year of Production (Year), Lead Actor (Starring), and a Synopsis. Start off by adding new DVDs to your list using the Add button. Functionality is also included to delete a dvd (use the Delete DVD button) should it become unplayable or to edit a DVDs information (use the "Edit DVD info" button) in the case something was improperly entered.

Each time you log in successfully, click the "Show All DVD's" button to view your collection or add something newly acquired using the "Add a New DVD" form.

Now you're playing with power!

Project User Stories:

As a user I want to be able to make my DVDs available for loan to my neighbors and have access to their DVDs as well so we can share our collective libraries amongst ourselves and enjoy a wider breadth of media options

As a user, I want to be able to search the collective DVD libraries of my participating neighbors so I can enjoy more movies and save money on buying or renting.

As a user I would like to see all DVDs owned by a certain neighbor so I can infer more about them based on their collection.

As a user I would like to see how many movies we have with a certain actor or director so I can power watch their collected works.

As a user I want to be able to add newly acquired movies to the full database of movies so my neighbors can view my home collection.

As a user I want to be able to delete a DVD if it has become unplayable so that it is no longer in viewing circulation.

Unsolved problems:  Well the scope of this project changed from inception with a need to focus on MVP so rather than a neighborhood DVD sharing platform facilitating the sharing of DVD media with people in close proximity, for now the project is more for a single user to chronicle their catalog for at a glance viewing that doesn't involve having to retrieve physical media. In the future I'd like to open it up so that all users can merge their collections for group play, but for now, MVP!  I also ditched on a search function and I'd like to add sorting methods to either sort by title or year etc.  Maybe in a refactor?
